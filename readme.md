The **Wedding Website Builder** website is a responsive, elegant, and user-friendly wedding website inspired by Zola. Built as a group project, this site showcases the ability to collaborate and recreate a professional-grade layout using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Users are presented with:
A hero section inviting them to start their wedding website
A gallery of stunning design templates
Key features like customizations, registry options, and RSVP integration
